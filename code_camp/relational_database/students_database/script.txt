You used the psql command to log in and interact with the database. You can use it to just run a single command and exit. Above your loop, add a PSQL variable that looks like this: PSQL="psql -X --username=freecodecamp --dbname=students --no-align --tuples-only -c" . This will allow you to query your database from your script. The important parts are the username, dbname, and the -c flag that is for running a single command and exiting. The rest of the flags are for formatting.
